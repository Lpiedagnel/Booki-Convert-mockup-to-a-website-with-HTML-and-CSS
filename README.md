# Booki: Convert mockup to a website with HTML and CSS

This is a student project for OpenClassrooms. The goal is to use HTML and CSS to match (as close as possible) the mockup we are given.

Warning: this is NOT an official correction by OpenClassrooms. This repo is only my work as a student.


## What is OpenClassrooms?

OpenClassrooms is a French online school which students have to submit several projects to validate our degree. This project “Booki” is the second one to the Web Developer course.


## Restrictions

For this project: we are forbidden to use:

- SASS or any other CSS Preprocessor
- CSS Grids
- em and rem values. We only allowed to use pixels and percentages.

This restriction exists to prevent new students to be overwhelmed with advanced technologies. This is only for this specific project and not for the later ones.
